# Loan-Approval-Prediction

## Description
Loan Approval Prediction is a machine learning project that automates the loan approval process by analyzing applicant data and predicting loan approvals using historical data and machine learning algorithms.

## Overview
Loan Approval Prediction is a machine learning project that aims to automate the loan approval process for financial institutions. By analyzing historical loan data and various applicant attributes, the system predicts whether a loan application should be approved or rejected.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) for insights
- Machine learning model training and evaluation
- Deployment of the predictive model
- Interactive dashboard for loan approval predictions

## Dataset
The dataset consists of loan applicant details, including:
- Applicantâ€™s financial history
- Income and employment status
- Credit rating
- Loan amount and tenure
- Other relevant attributes

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas & NumPy (Data Processing)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data Visualization)
- Scikit-Learn (Machine Learning)
- Flask/Django (Deployment, if applicable)
- Streamlit (Optional: Dashboard)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/saloninarang27/loan-approval-prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd loan-approval-prediction
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the model training script:
   ```sh
   python train_model.py
   ```
5. (Optional) Start the web application:
   ```sh
   python app.py
   ```

## Usage
- Run the Jupyter Notebook to explore the dataset and train the model.
- Use the web interface (if implemented) to predict loan approvals.
- Modify `config.py` to tweak model parameters.

## Model Evaluation
- Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics are used to evaluate the model.
- A confusion matrix is generated to analyze classification performance.
